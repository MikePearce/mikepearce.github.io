      <description>It started slowly, insidiously. It was a little like hair. Growing in the cracks and crevices underground, away from the sunlight. You saw it on the tube - platforms, tunnels - but a glance and then it’s gone, you ignore it. It was fine, so fine that it moved with the barest of breezes. Sometimes when you couldn’t detect a breeze. It was cleaned away, but would soon come back. Within a couple of days at first, then a day, then it grew back in a few hours.</description>
