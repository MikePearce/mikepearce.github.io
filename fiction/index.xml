      <description>It started slowly, insidiously. It was a little like hair. Growing in the cracks and crevices underground, away from the sunlight. You saw it on the tube - platforms, tunnels - but a glance and then it’s gone, you ignore it. It was fine, so fine that it moved with the barest of breezes. Sometimes when you couldn’t detect a breeze. It was cleaned away, but would soon come back. Within a couple of days at first, then a day, then it grew back in a few hours.</description>

      <description>‘I promise you, ‘ she said, thrusting a finger at me, ‘you’re going to die.’
She was factually correct. I would, at some point, die. However, it wasn’t going to be because of her and it certainly wasn’t going to be soon.
&amp;lsquo;I’ve been in touch with the Police, they think you are a criminal.’. She said, still thrusting, her face screwed into a mask of disgust.
I didn’t believe her, there’s no way she went to the police, besides, what she didn’t know, is that I had already been to the police, I went to hand myself in.</description>
