      <description>What is it? An event storming session to map out what the website does.
Why do we need it? We want to be able to split the platform with sensible divisions so that different squads can own different parts. Running an event storming session should allow us to identify everything the platform does, who does it and why it happens.
From there, we should be able to easily identify areas of commonality or similarity.</description>

It started slowly, insidiously. It was a little like hair. Growing in the cracks and crevices underground, away from the sunlight. You saw it on the tube - platforms, tunnels - but a glance and then it’s gone, you ignore it. It was fine, so fine that it moved with the barest of breezes. Sometimes when you couldn’t detect a breeze. It was cleaned away, but would soon come back.</description>

      <description>‘I promise you, ‘ she said, thrusting a finger at me, ‘you’re going to die.’
She was factually correct. I would, at some point, die. However, it wasn’t going to be because of her and it certainly wasn’t going to be soon.
&amp;lsquo;I’ve been in touch with the Police, they think you are a criminal.’. She said, still thrusting, her face screwed into a mask of disgust.
I didn’t believe her, there’s no way she went to the police, besides, what she didn’t know, is that I had already been to the police, I went to hand myself in.</description>
